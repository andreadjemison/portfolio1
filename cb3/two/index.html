                    Rhonda was born in Australia and began her career as a radio producer before moving into television
                    production. In 2006 her work took a very different direction when she released The Secret film,
                    viewed
                    by
                    millions across the planet. She followed with The Secret book, a worldwide best seller available in
                    50
                    languages with over 20 million copies in print.
                    <br><br>
                    Since its release in November 2006, The Secret book has remained on the New York Times bestseller
                    list
                    for
                    190 weeks and was named by USA Today as one of the top 20-bestselling books of the past 15 years. In
                    January
                    of 2007, Rhonda appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show with four teachers from The Secret film. In May
                    of
                    2007,
                    Rhonda Byrne was recognized as one of the world’s most influential people in TIME magazine’s “The
                    TIME
                    100:
                    The People Who Shape Our World”, and shortly afterwards appeared in Forbes’ “The Celebrity 100”
                    list.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2010, Rhonda continued her work with the book The Power, the second book in The Secret Book
                    Series,
                    which
                    immediately became another New York Times bestseller. The Power is now available in 43 languages.
                    The
                    third
                    book in The Secret Book Series, The Magic, was released in 2012, and her latest book, Hero, the
                    fourth
                    in
                    The Secret Book Series, was released in 2013. Also released in 2013 was The Secret Daily Teachings
                    in a
                    brand new hardcover book edition.

                <p>
                    Rhonda’s daughter had given her a copy of The Science of Getting Rich, a book written in 1910 by
                    Wallace
                    D. Wattles. Of that moment, Rhonda says, “Something inside of me had me turn the pages one by one,
                    and I
                    can still remember my tears hitting the pages as I was reading it. It gave me a glimpse of The
                    Secret
                    and it was like a flame inside of my heart.”
                    <br><br>
                    What followed was a two-month odyssey of research and investigation as Rhonda traced The Secret back
                    through thousands of years, incorporating almost every religion and field of human endeavor
                    throughout
                    history.
                    <br> <br>
                    Almost immediately her life was transformed, as she began to put into practice all she had learned.
                    And
                    in that moment her greatest wish, and new life mission, was to share this knowledge with the world.
                    <br> <br>
                    In The Secret film and her book of the same name, both released in 2006, Rhonda Byrne presents
                    teachers
                    alive today who impart this special wisdom that has been known by so few. They include some of the
                    world’s leaders in the fields of business, economics, medicine, psychology, history, theology, and
                    science. The Secret reveals amazing real life stories of regular people who have changed their lives
                    in
                    profound ways. By applying The Secret they present instances of eradicating disease, acquiring
                    massive
                    wealth, overcoming obstacles and achieving what many would regard as impossible.
                    <br><br>
                    The Secret shows how to apply this powerful knowledge to your life in every area from health to
                    wealth,
                    to success and relationships.
