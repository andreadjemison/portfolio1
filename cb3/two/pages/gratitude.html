                            Rhonda was born in Australia and began her career as a radio producer before moving into television
                            production. In 2006 her work took a very different direction when she released The Secret film,
                            viewed
                            by
                            millions across the planet. She followed with The Secret book, a worldwide best seller available in
                            50
                            languages with over 20 million copies in print.

                            Since its release in November 2006, The Secret book has remained on the New York Times bestseller
                            list
                            for
                            190 weeks and was named by USA Today as one of the top 20-bestselling books of the past 15 years. In
                            January
                            of 2007, Rhonda appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show with four teachers from The Secret film. In May
                            of
                            2007,
                            Rhonda Byrne was recognized as one of the world’s most influential people in TIME magazine’s “The
                            TIME
                            100:
